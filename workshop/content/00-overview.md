In this course you will get a __deep__ introduction to the tool ``odo``. This tool provides a simplified command line client for deploying applications to OpenShift. 

The goal for this lab is to showcase `odo` and all of it's primitives and to do so we're going to use a sample application. Don't judge the code for this sample application as it has been developed just for training purposes.
