# Lab Developing applications with odo

The provided Ansible Playbook Bundle automates preparing an OpenShift cluster
for the Developing applications with odo Workshop by deploying required services which are used during the labs.

## Use an installed APB on OpenShift
Select the item from the catalog.

## Development
When you develop the APB you can test on a platform in the following ways.

### Install the apb tool
The new `apb` tool will help you develop your APB in an easy way. Download the latest apb tool 
from here: [https://github.com/automationbroker/apb/releases](https://github.com/automationbroker/apb/releases)

The [README.md](https://github.com/automationbroker/apb/blob/master/README.md) in that repository will give you a short getting started very insightful.

If you're starrting a new APB, you should look into the workflow in the [Getting started doc](https://github.com/automationbroker/apb/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md)

### Create a namespace to test
Once logged into your OCP cluster, you must first create a project:

```bash
oc new-project odo-workshop
```

### Update the com.redhat.apb.spec LABEL
If you've changed the apb.yml you will need to update the `com.redhat.apb.spec` LABEL with a base64 encoded version of apb.yml. To do this we need to run `apb bundle prepare`

```bash
apb bundle prepare
```

### Building and publishing your APB for testing

At this point we have a fully formed APB that we can build. In this example, we'll build an APB using the OpenShift build system. Let's first create a `buildconfig` for the APB. Perform this step when you're building a new APB that you haven't previously built on OpenShift:

```bash
oc new-build --binary=true --name odo-workshop
```

To start the build from the current directory and follow the logs:

```bash
oc start-build --follow --from-dir . odo-workshop
```

If the build completes successfully, you'll see some newly available imagestreams:

```bash
oc get is
NAME           DOCKER REPO                                                  TAGS      UPDATED
odo-workshop   docker-registry.default.svc:5000/odo-workshop/odo-workshop   latest    7 seconds ago
```

We can now add the internal OpenShift registry to our list of configured registries:

```bash
apb registry add my-registry --type local_openshift --namespaces odo-workshop
Getting specs for registry: [my-registry]
INFO Empty AuthType. Assuming credentials are defined in the config...
INFO == REGISTRY CX ==
INFO Name: my-registry
INFO Type: local_openshift
INFO Url:
INFO Validating specs...
INFO All specs passed validation!
INFO Registry my-registry has 1 valid APBs available from 1 images scanned
 APB                         IMAGE                                                          REGISTRY
 ----------------------- -+- ---------------------------------------------------------- -+- -----------
 lab-developing-with-odo  |  docker-registry.default.svc:5000/odo-workshop/odo-workshop  |  my-registry
```

### Running the APB
Now that `apb` is aware of the `starter-workshop-apb` APB in the registry, we can perform any supported action against the APB. The `apb bundle` subcommand gives you some actions you can perform on a specific bundle in a registry.

We can `provision` the `lab-developing-with-odo` that now exists in the registry by running:

```bash
apb bundle provision lab-developing-with-odo -n odo-workshop --follow
```

The provision command will prompt you for all required parameters to your APB.

__NOTE__: The `--follow` flag used above will show logs produced by the running APB.

You can `deprovision` the `slab-developing-with-odo` that now exists in the registry by running:

```bash
apb bundle deprovision lab-developing-with-odo -n odo-workshop --follow
```

The deprovision command will prompt you for the specific instance to delete and all required parameters to your APB.
